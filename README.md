## 'Varied Vancouver'
A 'crowd-sourced' collection of places of interest in Vancouver (and anywhere vaguely nearby). Please offer us places that you find interesting but are likely yet unknown to most of us.

### Exercise criteria:

* Many of these are going to be represented as points, but some of them may be polygons or lines. All of them should have some attribute data filled out. In GeoJSON, each entity can have an entirely different set of attributes, so you don't have to follow your neighbors! And do [remember](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/20086/assignments/syllabus), you don't have to contribute personally identifiable information. You can explore the styling options!

* Each student in 472 contributes at least one point.

* Must use GitHub/git and geojson.io. You can't use the GitHub.com interface. **No manual uploading or downloading or copying or pasting!** Tips: You want to clone a fork of this repo to your local computer. And you want to use the geojson.io Open -> File menu item (*not* the Open -> Github). And you may have to manually replace the Varied-Vancouver.geojson file in your local folder with the updated one you saved out of the geojson.io app. Then, think... how do you get to the point of issuing a pull request?

* Make sure you don't rename any files in (or add any new files to) the 'remote'/online version of Varied-Vancouver that we're all looking at.

* Collaboratively and constructively ensure that each and every member of the group has an adequate understanding of what exactly you all did today, such that any of your group members could be chosen to explain what was done and why.

### Submission process:

* Second-to-last step for this project should be to issue @geoglrb a pull request to merge in your thoughtful additions to the GeoJSON file.

* Last step is to have @geoglrb merge the results and you verify the map. Depending on how many pull requests I get and how quickly, you might have to wait until after class to verify the map.
